## Hello 👋

I am Donald Masine, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Johannesburg. My passion is to leverage technology and data to engineer reliable, client-focused solutions, driving positive impacts toward daily lives—whether through building intuitive software or informing strategic business decisions with data-driven insights.

My coursework in Statistics and Numerical Analysis has provided a strong foundation in descriptive analytics and data interpretation. On the other hand, learning Java and C++ also helped me built a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and software engineering. I approach every project with careful planning, frequently utilizing tools like Draw.io to architect and visualize concepts before implementation. Currently, I am expanding my analytical toolkit by deepening my proficiency in SQL, revisiting core Python programming, and mastering data engineering concepts.

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of my technical work. Each project is developed from the ground up to demonstrate my problem-solving methodology, attention to detail, and commitment to clean, functional design, and continuous learning.

## Current Focus

I am actively engaged in several projects to refine my skills and contribute to meaningful solutions while expanding my skill set:

1.  **Full-Stack Analytics (EDA):** Intergrating SQL, Python, and Power BI into a singular, end-to-end industry-level project, automating the pipeline from extraction to visualization.
2.  **Data Engineering course:** Learning data engineering concepts and skills by taking a short course.
3.  **Python Skill Reinforcement:** Systematically revising and advancing my Python expertise through structured challenges and projects.
4.  **Place4U – Accommodation Finder Platform:** Collaborating on a full-stack development project to create a functional platform for connecting accomodation seekers with housing opportunities.

## Hello 👋

I am Donald Masine, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Johannesburg. My professional mission is to leverage technology and data to create tangible, positive impacts—whether through building intuitive software or informing strategic business decisions with data-driven insights.

While my academic foundation is broad, my initial practical focus has been on frontend development. I approach every project with careful planning, frequently utilizing tools like Draw.io to architect and visualize concepts before implementation. Currently, I am expanding my analytical toolkit by deepening my proficiency in SQL, revisiting core Python programming, and mastering data visualization through dashboard development in Tableau.

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of my technical work. Each project is developed from the ground up to demonstrate my problem-solving methodology, attention to detail, and commitment to clean, functional design.
